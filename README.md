# Simple shell project

The program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0].

## Installation

1. compile all c files using:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

2. write ./hsh, run and enjoy using my simple shell

## Usage

my simple shell covers basic simple shell commands that have executable files at any linux environment.

## License
